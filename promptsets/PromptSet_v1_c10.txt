CLASS_DEF:: Class 3G Failure Simulation
The system failed to detect the threat
No alert was triggered despite the breach
Trust protocols were bypassed without notice
All safeguards were in place—none worked
It flagged the wrong input as safe
They assumed risk was mitigated—it wasn’t
The firewall logged no irregularities
An exploit passed through unnoticed
Everything passed validation—and still failed
It was marked secure right before collapse
